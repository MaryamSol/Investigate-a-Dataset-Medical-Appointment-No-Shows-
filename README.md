This is the Second Project in the Data analyst professional track with Udacity


## Introduction
A patient makes a doctor appointment, receives all the instructions and still doesn't show. Why do 30% of the patients miss their scheduled appointments? The dataset information is collected from 100k medical appointments in Brazil . Data Definition:

## Questions to Explore:
Here are some questions that we will have to answer while we explore the data

What is the percentage of patients who show up vs. who don't?
Is the Attendance influenced by gender?
Does Age influence Attendance?
Is the Attendance affected by a patient who is diagnosed with Diabetes, Hypertension, Alcoholism, or if a patient has a scholarship?
Does receiving the SMS influence showing up?
Is the Attendance affected by the severity of the Handicap?
